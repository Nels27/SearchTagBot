            <h2>mBed / C++ Side</h2>
            <p class="lead mb-5"> When trying to communicate from Raspberry Pi to mbed we had been trying to use the controller to write outputs to the mBed
                from the RPi, since it could connect to it via bluetooth. One issue we realized outright was that it was difficult to send entire strings to the mBed
                over a serial connection. The serial method for mbed uses a device.getc() method which only takes in one character at a time. Therefore anything longer
                would get truncated. So the controller would not be able to send "Right Joystick moved right" for example. We decided to dedicate each controller action to one ASCII
                character since there were over 52 and there were way less controller actions to be mapped.</p>

            <p class="lead mb-5"> Another issue we had was being able to lock in the heading for particular moments when initiating the tagging protocol from the controller.
                We needed a way to differentiate them from each other and it was decided to use a timer to start and stop on forward and turning movement. This was written to the SD
                card so that it could be parsed by the C# gui and plot correctly.</p>


            <h2>Raspberr Pi / Python Side</h2>
            <p class="lead mb-5"> There were a few issues on the RPi side. The main one being that we were unable to use Open CV on it. Initially we wanted to use OpenCV to track all of
                our items in our environment by filtering it's color from the environment via a mask. We learned that installing OpenCV on a RPi has two issues. First one being it takes
                an extremely long time to do so. Second once it install it disables the initial use of the camera so it defeats the entire purpose of installing it there in the first place.
                Thus we deferred to using the Google Vision API and it's label request tool to identify features in the environment.</p>

                <p class ="lead mb-5"> Additionally we had the controller issue for the RPi side since we were trying to use bluetooth. The controller would only stay connected for 2 milliseconds
                    before getting kicked out. So this is why we defaulted to MQTT, which is detailed more later.</p>

                    <p></p>

                <h2>Figuring out how to control the robot</h2>
                <p class="lead mb-5"> Originally we had decided to use a Dualshock Playstation 4 controller to provide the user
                    more of an intuitive layout for controlling the robot rather than just the bluetooth app. There were a few issues
                    with this. Since the controller was capable of bluetooth it could be easily connected to the Raspberry Pi using the
                    bluetooth capabilities. At first this worked, but once we switched over to Raspbian for Robots it stopped functioning.
                    The controller had to be connected in a different way so we explored using<a href="https://www.eclipse.org/paho/clients/python/"> MQTT</a>, which is a machine to machine IOT connectivitiy
                    protocol. This would require us to make one of the devices a client and one of them the broker. Therefore we connected the controller
                    to a personal PC running linux and subscribed to a specific topic for the controller, while connecting to the RPi via IP address over the same
                    wifi network. The communication from PC to RPi for controller outputs was successful, but for some reason writing to the serial port of the mBed
                    was not successful. Each controller output was mapped to a particular character, which was processed by the mbed and caused some sort of robot action.
                    We felt that if we had a little more time we probably would have figured it out. However, in an effort to keep it wireless we switched the control
                    scheme over to bluetooth with switch case statements.</p>

                    <p></p>
                    <p></p>

                    <p class="lead mb-5"> Here is a look at the controller.</p>

                    <p></p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p class="lead mb-5"> This would have been the intended control method for the entire setup.</p>

                    <img class="img-fluid" src="img/controllerMqttFlowChart.png" alt="">

                    <p></p>
                    <p></p>



                <h2>Mapping Issues</h2>
                <p class="lead mb-5"> The mapping was intended to be real-time with the robot, but the main issue was communicating with the GUI and the RPi since the GUI was in C# and the RPi code was in python.
                    Once we moved away from making it real time we were able to not worry about writing from the RPi to the GUI instantly, but instead logging the correct data and processing it after the fact.</p>

                    <p class="lead mb-5"> Outside of that we were originally planning to use the IMU, however, based on our software organization in the mbed code once we used the IMU.begin() method it locked up
                        everything in our code. We instead devised a work around by averaging the rate of speed of a forward movement, left turn movement, and right turn movement. We set these a predetermined values,
                        so that when the timer was used, the value could be multiplied by this rate and the amount of distance traveled could be found. This would then be processed by the GUI. Unfortunately this was not
                        entirely accurate, so a compounded error even after scaling caused the generated plot to be off. Possible solutions that were recommended were using a new IMU chip that contained its on internal ARM processor
                        this way that process can be offloaded from the mbed.</p>
